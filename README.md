📜 PreambleThis license was created to address a common failure in traditional software and hardware licensing: the permanent restriction of works that are no longer produced, supported, or commercially maintained.The LRL establishes a time-based transition between exclusive commercial ownership and cultural, technical, and historical preservation. It recognizes that artifacts deserve an afterlife beyond abandonment.⏳ Phased Licensing ModelThe LRL operates in three distinct stages, moving from closed to community-driven.🔴 Phase I — Full ExclusivityStatus: Active Production or SupportRights: Full commercial rights retained by Licensor.Restrictions: No modification, redistribution, or reverse engineering without explicit permission.🟡 Phase II — Legacy Release (Afterlife Initiation)Status: Production ceased + Support discontinued (Default: 3-5 years)Permissions: Study, modify, create compatibility patches, and non-commercial forks.Preservation: Emulation and archival are permitted.Restrictions: No commercial sale; no use of Trademarked Elements.🟢 Phase III — Heritage ReleaseStatus: End of support + X years (Default: 10-15 years)Permissions: Source code released publicly; unrestricted educational/research use.Spirit: Historical preservation and museum inclusion are explicitly allowed.🛠️ DefinitionsTermDefinitionLicensorThe original copyright holder.Licensed WorkSoftware, firmware, hardware design, or related assets.SupportOfficial updates, patches, or customer assistance.ProductionActive manufacturing or commercial sale.TrademarkedNames, logos, and characters owned by the Licensor.[!CAUTION]Important Notice: This license is provided “as is” and does not constitute legal advice.
