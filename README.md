📜 Preamble
This license was created to address a common failure in traditional software and hardware licensing: the permanent restriction of works that are no longer produced, supported, or commercially maintained.

The LRL establishes a time-based transition between exclusive commercial ownership and cultural, technical, and historical preservation. It recognizes that artifacts deserve an afterlife beyond abandonment.

⏳ Phased Licensing Model
The LRL operates in three distinct stages, moving from closed to community-driven.

🔴 Phase I — Full Exclusivity
Status: Active Production or Support
Rights: Full commercial rights retained by Licensor.
Restrictions: No modification, redistribution, or reverse engineering without explicit permission.

🟡 Phase II — Legacy Release (Afterlife Initiation)
Status: Production ceased + Support discontinued (Default: 3–5 years)
Permissions: Study, modify, create compatibility patches, and non-commercial forks.
Preservation: Emulation and archival are permitted.
Restrictions: No commercial sale; no use of Trademarked Elements.

🟢 Phase III — Heritage Release
Status: End of support + X years (Default: 10–15 years)
Permissions: Source code released publicly; unrestricted educational and research use.
Spirit: Historical preservation and museum inclusion are explicitly allowed.

🛠️ Definitions
Licensor — The original copyright holder.
Licensed Work — Software, firmware, hardware design, or related assets.
Support — Official updates, patches, or customer assistance.
Production — Active manufacturing or commercial sale.
Trademarked — Names, logos, and characters owned by the Licensor.

⚖️ License Terms (v1.0 — Draft)

1. Attribution Requirement
All Community Versions must clearly state:
“Based on the original work by [Licensor Name]. This is an unofficial, community-maintained version.”

2. Optional Tribute Clause 🎖️
Licensors may require symbolic attribution (credits, documentation mention).
No financial obligation may be enforced.

3. No Warranty
The Licensed Work is provided “as is”.
The Licensor bears no responsibility for damages arising from Community Versions.

4. Termination
Failure to comply with these terms results in automatic termination of granted permissions.

🧠 Philosophical Statement
No meaningful work is left to rot behind locked doors once its creators have chosen to walk away.

TL;DR — How LRL compares to MIT and GPL

Feature                          | MIT | GPL | LRL / Afterlife
---------------------------------|-----|-----|-----------------
Open from day one                | Yes | Yes | No
Allows commercial use            | Yes | Yes | No (until legacy phase)
Requires sharing modifications   | No  | Yes | No (non-commercial only)
Protects trademarks              | No  | No  | Yes
Time-based release               | No  | No  | Yes
Designed for abandoned software  | No  | No  | Yes
Allows mods after end of support | No  | No  | Yes
Focus on preservation            | No  | No  | Yes

In one sentence

MIT: Do whatever you want, even sell it.
GPL: Do whatever you want, but share it back.
LRL: Do whatever you want — after I stop caring — and keep it alive.

"Giving code a second life."
