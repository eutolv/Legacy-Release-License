📜 Preamble
This license was created to address a common failure in traditional software and hardware licensing: the permanent restriction of works that are no longer produced, supported, or commercially maintained.

The LRL establishes a time-based transition between exclusive commercial ownership and cultural, technical, and historical preservation. It recognizes that artifacts deserve an afterlife beyond abandonment.

⏳ Phased Licensing Model
The LRL operates in three distinct stages, moving from closed to community-driven.

🔴 Phase I — Full Exclusivity
Status: Active Production or Support

Rights: Full commercial rights retained by Licensor.

Restrictions: No modification, redistribution, or reverse engineering without explicit permission.

🟡 Phase II — Legacy Release (Afterlife Initiation)
Status: Production ceased + Support discontinued (Default: 3-5 years)

Permissions: Study, modify, create compatibility patches, and non-commercial forks.

Preservation: Emulation and archival are permitted.

Restrictions: No commercial sale; no use of Trademarked Elements.

🟢 Phase III — Heritage Release
Status: End of support + X years (Default: 10-15 years)

Permissions: Source code released publicly; unrestricted educational/research use.

Spirit: Historical preservation and museum inclusion are explicitly allowed.
